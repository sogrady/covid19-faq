# COVID-19 FAQ

This is a quick project begun to roll up the various facts, figures and open questions surrounding the outbreak of the coronavirus, more correctly referred to as coronavirus disease 19, or COVID-19. 

Like a lot of people, I've consumed volumes of information on the subject which were useful for filling out the broader picture of the disease and its impacts. When it came to specific questions or issues, however, I kept having to hunt through various articles to find the one that answered the specific question I had. Rather than continue to do that, I decided to throw together a quick site that would try and answer specific questions, linking in each case directly back to the original source material. 

I am not a medical professional and don't play one on TV, but I have some experience in research and sifting through technical materials to answer specific questions - hence this project. 

It's been useful for me; I hope it's useful for you as well. 

## Governance and Pull Requests
I plan to keep this site updated, if only because the process is relatively low friction. That being said, if those reading this have questions they're looking to answer or, conversely, answers that might make good additions I am not averse to pull requests. 

I make no promises that they'll be accepted, but if they fit within the context and purpose of the site - which is to say answering specific questions succinctly - pull requests will be considered. 

If you have more significant ideas for contributions and want to know ahead of time if they'd be welcome, feel free to reach out directly.
