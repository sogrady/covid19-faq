Who is most at risk?
The most at risk populations today are the elderly. To [quote](https://virologydownunder.com/so-you-think-youve-about-to-be-in-a-pandemic/) Ian M Mackay, PhD and Katherine E Arden PhD: 

> To date, looking at data from China (below), most (94%) deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in those aged over 50 years of age, with more than half (51%) in those aged over 70 years. The age group most at risk for death are those aged over 80 years.

The younger you are, in general, the less likely you are to experience serious symptoms. This is particularly true if you do not suffer from potential complicating factors such as asthma or other respiratory ailments. 

It appears that men may be more suceptible to severe infections than women. Per the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-flu.html?auth=login-email&login=email):

> Death rates among men infected with the coronavirus in China, particularly those in their late 40s and older, have exceeded those among women, a pattern not seen in the seasonal flu. The reason for the discrepancy is not known, although Chinese men do smoke more, often resulting in compromised lung function.

For those with children, these [words](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html) from the CDC may offer some comfort: "These limited reports suggest that children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms, and though severe complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock) have been reported, they appear to be uncommon."
